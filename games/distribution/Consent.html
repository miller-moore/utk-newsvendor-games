                A team of researchers at the University of Tennessee is looking to understand ordering decisions in different contexts.
                You are invited to partake in an economics game to help us better understand the relationships between context and ordering decisions.

                Participants will receive bonus pay, calculated by performance during a randomly picked round
                in the game. This bonus pay will be given to you in cash before you leave the room.
                Please let the instructor at the front of the room know when you have completed the experiment.
